# Predicting Even/Odd Numbers in 4-Digit Sequences

## Problem Statement
Predict whether the next number in a 4-digit sequence (1000-9999) will be even or odd, aiming for >70% accuracy.

## Implementation Approach

### Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather 4-digit numbers (1000-9999)
   - Store in structured format (CSV/JSON)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Last digit analysis
   - Consecutive number differences
   - Digit-based features (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones)
   - Lag features

3. **Model Selection**
   - Baseline: Logistic Regression
   - Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
   - Sequential: Hidden Markov Models

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC
   - Cross-validation

### Recommended Models
1. Random Forest (initial choice)
2. XGBoost (for boosting accuracy)
3. LSTM (for sequential patterns)

## Deployment
- Package model (Pickle, ONNX)
- Create prediction API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## Key Insights
While random sequences have 50% accuracy, structured patterns can be leveraged to improve predictions through:
- Advanced feature engineering
- Sequential pattern recognition
- Ensemble learning techniques
